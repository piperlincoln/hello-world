Repository for MET CS 633 Module #2 Assignment #1

My name is Piper Lincoln and I am a graduate student at BU MET studying Software Development.
An interesting fact about myself is I was a gymnast for 17 years and I competed nationally through my Sophomore year of college.
A goal I set for 2021 is to become more comfortable with JavaScript and PHP.
